# Информация за tech stack-а / Tech Stack Overview
## Frontend: React with Material-UI
### Description:
Our frontend utilizes React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Material-UI, a React UI framework implementing Google's Material Design. React's component-based architecture simplifies UI management, while Material-UI ensures a visually appealing and consistent user experience.

### Reasoning:
- **React:** Chosen for its component-based structure, facilitating efficient UI development and updates.
- **Material-UI:** Selected for its implementation of Material Design, offering a cohesive and polished UI design.

## Backend: Django with JWT Authentication

### Description:
The backend is built on Django, a Python web framework, and employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Django's rapid development capabilities are complemented by JWT's stateless authentication for secure communication between frontend and backend.

### Reasoning:
- **Django:** Selected for its high-level abstractions, enabling rapid development, maintainability, and scalability.
- **JWT Authentication:** Provides a secure, stateless mechanism for handling user authentication and authorization.

## Database: MongoDB with Djongo ODM

### Description:
Our database choice is MongoDB, a NoSQL database, with Djongo serving as the Object-Document Mapper (ODM). Djongo allows seamless integration with Django models, providing flexibility and scalability.

### Reasoning:
- **MongoDB:** Chosen for its flexibility and scalability, ideal for handling large volumes of data.
- **Djongo ODM:** Enables working with Django models while storing data in MongoDB, leveraging the strengths of both.

## API Documentation: OpenAPI Specification

### Description:
API documentation follows the OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger), providing a standardized way to document and describe RESTful APIs. This ensures clear and consistent API design.

### Reasoning:
- **OpenAPI Specification:** Facilitates standardized API documentation, promoting clarity and consistency in API design. Enables easy generation of documentation, client SDKs, and server stubs.
